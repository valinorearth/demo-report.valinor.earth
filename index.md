## AI-Enhanced Satellite Imagery (2016 - 2023)

In-house Machine Learning Analysis of Forestation Changes with 160GB of Satellite Data coerced from multiple sources (Landsat-8, Landsat-9, Sentinel-2) on multiple bands (RBG + Multi-Spectral).

## How

We broke down the visible (RBG) and non-visible (near infra-red) bands and enhanced their resolution using AI to feed into our proprietary classification and clustering  algorithm to detect land-cover and look for forestation changes.
